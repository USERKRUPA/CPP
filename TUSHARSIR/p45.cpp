/*
Write a class Matrix which will store elements of integer matrix (two dimensional array) in dynamically allocated space. Provide below functions in matrix class - 
	1. Default constructor - Take 3 as default row and column size. Initialize the matrix elements to 0
	2. Parameterized constructor - Takes row and column size as parameters. Initialize matrix to 0.
	3. Copy constructor - Performs deep copy of matrix object.
	4. Destructor - Deletes memory which is allocated dynamically.
	5. Overloaded + operator - Performs addition of two matrices.
	6. Overloaded ! operator - Calculates transpose of a user entered square matrix.
	7. Overload >> - Accepts row & column size from user. Also accepts matrix elements from user.
	8. Overload << - Displays matrix.
